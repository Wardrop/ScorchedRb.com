Light-weight, DRY as a desert, web framework for Ruby
=====================================================

Scorched is a generic, unopinionated, light-weight web framework for Ruby. Scorched provides a generic yet powerful set of constructs for processing HTTP requests, at the heart of which is the nestable, inheritable, Scorched::Controller.

Magicians Not Welcome
---------------------
Scorched aims to be raw and transparent. Magic has no place, or need. A thoughtful and simple design means there's no requirement for magic. Because of that, most developers should be able to master scorched in an evening, if that.

Part of what keeps Scorched lightweight, is that unlike other lightweight web frameworks that attempt to hide Rack in the background, Scorched makes no such attempts, very rarely providing functionality that overlaps with that already provided by Rack. In fact, familiarity is somewhat of a pre-requisite to mastering Scorched.



While Scorched provides enough out-of-the-box features to build a small website, its real strength is shown when you extend out and on-top of it.
