Simple, Powerful, Scorched
==========================

Scorched is a generic, unopinionated, light-weight web framework for Ruby. Scorched provides a generic yet powerful set of constructs for processing HTTP requests, at the heart of which is the nestable, inheritable, Scorched::Controller.

Getting Started
---------------

    # ruby
    class App < Scorched::Controller
      get '/' do
        'hello world'
      end
    end
       
    {:dog => 'meow', :cat => Roof, :zebra => "Bark #{roo + 'cat'}"}
       
    @cat = 'roof'
    @@dog = 'bark'
    $horse = 'hark'
