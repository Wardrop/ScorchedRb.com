If you need help, want to ask a question, leave a comment, or pretty much anything else, you can use the following communication channels. I receive notifications whenever something is posted to any of these.

* [GitHub Issue Tracker](http://github.com/wardrop/Scorched/issues) - For reporting bugs, make features request and raise proposals.
* [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/scorched) - For questions and general discussion. Also doubles as the Scorched mailing list.
* [#scorched](irc://irc.freenode.net/scorched) - The official #scorched IRC channel is hosted on [irc.freenode.net](http://freenode.net). Use this channel for questions and general discussion; consider it a real-time version of the Scorched Google Group.

In addition, each page of documentation has an embedded Disqus widget for commenting on anything related to the documentation on that page. Any documentation that's lacking information, or needs correcting, should be raised as an issue in [GitHub Issue Tracker](http://github.com/wardrop/Scorched/issues).

If you want to keep something private or boost my ego with praise, you can contact me by email: <a href="mailto:tom@tomwardrop.com">tom@tomwardrop.com</a>
