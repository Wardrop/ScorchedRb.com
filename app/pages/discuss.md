If you need help, want to ask a question, leave a comment, or pretty much anything else, you can use the following communication channels. I receive notifications whenever something is posted to any of these.

* [GitHub Issue Tracker](http://github.com/wardrop/Scorched/issues) - For reporting bugs, making feature requests and proposing ideas.
* [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/scorched) - For questions and general discussion. Also doubles as the Scorched mailing list for those a little more old-school.
* [#scorched](irc://irc.freenode.net/scorched) - The official #Scorched IRC channel is hosted on [irc.freenode.net](http://freenode.net). Use this channel for questions and general discussion; consider it a real-time version of the Scorched Google Group.

Any documentation that's lacking information, or needs correcting, should be raised as an issue in [GitHub Issue Tracker](http://github.com/wardrop/Scorched/issues).

If you want to keep something private or boost my ego with praise, you can contact me by email: <a href="mailto:tom@tomwardrop.com">tom@tomwardrop.com</a>
